Anti Life Purposed Human Adversary, the invaders, nightmare beyond our beliefs.

When we thought of Extra-terestrial beings, we imagined short grey-skined humanoids who came in peace, Turns out what comes are living beings created for the sole purpose of eradicating life.

Not for fun, nor for food.
But rather for their sole purpose to strive.
